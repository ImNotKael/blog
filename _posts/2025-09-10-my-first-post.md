This is my first ever ranting session

You wanna read? I don't mind, incase if it is really entertaining to you. But my 2025 summer experience was definitely different from all of the other expereiences I have Other than that it felt really good that I had a amazing break after the stuff that I have done. I'll now explain what it was like from the begining.

After I got my report at the last day of school, I was satisfied that I got all my credits. Even as my regents too. Apart from me not having enough time to study for the physics regents, my junior year was overall good. I enjoyed my break for a week until something sort of weird happened but was reasonable.

While I was casually playing games like the person I am, my mother came into my room. She was wondering on why I have Summer school. I was very confused on what did she mean by that because I didn't get a yellow paper, which means that you are enrolled in summer school. Because of that, I was very confused on why I have summer school. I even checked my email and now they told me that I have somewhere to go to. I was very angry because I passed all my classes and the physics regents was basically optional. I kept myself on wondering why I have summer school, but I have no other choice but to find out why I am supposed to be there for.

So the day has come. The day where I report to school to get my credits which I already have to graduate highschool. Once I got my schedule, I was very confused but very understandable on why I am here. US history. One of the class that I took the regent in January. Unfortunately I did not get enough sleep for the regents and I pretty much slept for the whole entire session, which led me to a fail of having a 61, 4 points away from getting at least a 65. This was all because not only I didnt get enough sleep for the US regents, but I also lacked on my study which came to a realization that I have to be here every day for the US regent. I did some little bit of researching on what do you need to Graduate for highschool. Apparantly I have all 5 regents, which was: Algebra, English, Living Environment, Global History, and any kind of approval regent for me to get the regents diploma. The 5th one didn't really worry about me a lot considering that I took the algebra II regents and got a pretty good score.

Now, the class was extremely boring, there was completely nobody that I knew about and it was all just crazy people and it made me really uncomfortable. Eventually I got tired of it and decided to not go for it, considering that I really don't need it and will be fine for the regents diploma. My mom kept convincing that I should go for the advanced regents diploma, but I wanted to have a calm year afterwards and decided to have all of my summer at home and with my family. But that was huge mistake because there after I broke free of summer school, I realized that I am almost good to try and get the advanced regents diploma.

I entered School for the first and last time and I talked to the principal. They knew that I wanted my summer break, so we talked for a while and told me that I didn't need the class that much and gave me a waiver considering that I almost passed the regents. Not only I was free from summer school, but I got a waiver and now I am one step closer on taking any kind of regent in order for me to pass. This was a very interesting summer school year and I realized that some little parts in my past may become a big problem overtime. Overall, after what I had to just go through, Everything was fine as usual. My summer was very fun and I'd wish to experience it again excluding the summer school part.
