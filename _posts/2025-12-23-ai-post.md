Another part of another rant: My opinions on AI

So recently I've watched this very interesting movie called I Robot. The movie was basically about AI having a huge influence on humanity. Based on how I view it, it really looks like as if AI is really going to take over the world if they were to have a little amount of concious of themselves. The plot is pretty good but the quality was so bad but I understand it was a 2004 film so they didn't really have good technology or advantage of editing stuff. I got some three things to talk about for this movie and how it somewhat catched my eyes.

One example from this movie is where a scene of a robot trying to return a purse to a woman. This scene somewhat caught my eye because the main character thinks the robot is robbing due to the way how it grabs the purse and runs with it. This scene concludes to myself that AI cannot understand human emotion accurately and less likely would in the future.

Another scene that interested me when watching the movie is where a robot that appears very differently from the rest. This robot here wasn't like any other, but it states that they have emotion and feels human feelings. They can even dream whenever they are set to sleep which is surprisingly weird to me considering that robots do not have any source of human organs inside them. This scene really wonders myself if AI would be able to understand human emotions or just say it because they are programmed to.

One last scene that I took from this movie is the fight against the central AI program which basically has control over every aspect of technology. When the Central AI program acted like a villian, it really confuses me on why it is trying to take over the human world with confidence and anger. I really wonder why no company has no control over it. It somewhat tells me that in this movie, humans really rely on technology and AI to the point they doubt that nothing bad happens until something catastrophic comes in, taking lives for no what so ever reason.

To conclude, this movie really attempted to change me by showing that AI can have emotions like us humans. As much effort as they can to prove it, I still doubt that it would ever likely happen. Regardless, they are all machines. Not something that was birthed by humans. But there is no denying that AI are able to handle jobs way more easier than humans. AI should be used as a tool, not something to rely on.
