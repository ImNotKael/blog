My other part of ranting about: Debugging in python.

So as I am coding in python, I noticed there is a very different tool that doesn't really fit apart of the whole python3 thing to me. That is what I call: Debugging. Basically to summerize it up, Debugging is a tool in python where it shows the users steps on what the output is doing, like going through conditionals, statements, and even errors. At first, Debugging looks useless to some people who just started using python, but it actually could help you on something that you have done wrong step by step. Here are four examples of how i used debugging process to solve logical problems.
